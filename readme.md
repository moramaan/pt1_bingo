# Â¡BINGO GAME!

__This is a final unit project of Programming Module. 1st course of CFGS DAW.__

*It was developed with Java SDK 11 and Ant library.*

1. Everyone used to know Bingo Game. For those who don't, it is a gambling game that consists of a hype with a quantity certain numbered balls inside. This is a very popular game all over the world of which there are two typical varieties, which are 90 ball bingo and 75 ball bingo.
Players play with cards where there are random numbers within the corresponding range, 1-75 or 1-90. An announcer draws balls from the bass drum, singing the numbers aloud. 
If a player has that number on his cardboard, cross it out, and the game continues like this until someone manages to mark either a line or all the numbers of their cardboard. When this happens the player has to say out loud: "LINE!!" or "BINGO!!".

2. This project intends to be a way to practice modularized structure using all the knowledge aqquired in this unit and the previous ones. Trying to develop a kind of bingo game I worked with and consolidated the following topics:

- Variables and Finals
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Simple Arrays
- Two dimensions Arrays
- Functions
- Basic Javadoc
- Basic Objects (optional)
