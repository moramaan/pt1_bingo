# Â¡BINGO GAME!

__This is a final unit project of Programming Module. 1st course of CFGS DAW.__

*It was developed with Java SDK 11 and Ant library.*

1. We've all heard about Bingo Game. For those who did not, here is a quick explanation: it is a game that consists of a hype with an amount of certain numbered balls inside. It's a very popular game around the world with two typical varieties, which are 90 ball bingo and 75 ball bingo. Players play with cards that have random numbers in their range, 1-75 or 1-90, then an announcer takes balls from the bass drum, singing the numbers out loud. When a player has the number announced on his cardboard, crosses it out, and the game continues until someone manages to mark either a line or all the numbers of their cardboard. When this happens the player has to say out loud: "LINE!!" or "BINGO!!".

2. This project intends to be a way to practice modularized structure using all the knowledge aqquired in this unit and the previous ones. Trying to develop a kind of bingo game I worked with and consolidated the following topics:

- Variables and Finals
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Simple Arrays
- Two dimensions Arrays
- Functions
- Basic Javadoc
- Basic Objects (optional)
